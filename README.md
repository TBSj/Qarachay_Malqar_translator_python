Authors: Bogdan Tewnalany, Ali Berberov

As a base we took mbart-50 model and trained it on 27235 parallel sentences between russian and Qarachay-Malqar languages. It is not enough for good prediction, nevertheless, there is some result. 

Nowdays, we are collecting more sentence to improve our result. And, I hope, it gives us opportunity to not use pre-trained models and realize translator on R instead of python.
